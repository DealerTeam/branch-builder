# Branch Build Scripts
Branch Orgs are the place you perform feature development.  These orgs allow you to work within the 'dealer' namespace but not contaminate the master code branch.  A few things to know about Branch Orgs.

1) By default they are empty (No metadata yo)
2) You can modify stuff that the managed codebase may not actually allow
3) It's a great scratchpad.  If you break something, only you will notice.
