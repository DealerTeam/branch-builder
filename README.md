# Branch Build Scripts
Branch Orgs are the place you perform feature development.  These orgs allow you to work within the 'dealer' namespace but not contaminate the master code branch.  A few things to know about Branch Orgs.

1) By default they are empty (No metadata yo)<br />
2) You can modify stuff that the managed codebase may not actually allow<br/>
3) It's a great scratchpad.  If you break something, only you will notice.<br/>
